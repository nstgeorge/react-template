# React Template

This is the template I use for new React projects.

[Example deployment here.](https://natestgeorge.com/react-template)

## How to Use

I recommend using degit to grab this repo.

```sh
degit nstgeorge/react-template my-project # grab the repo
cd my-project
npm install # install dependencies
npm run dev # start dev server
```

That should be it! Your page is at [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) by default. Feel free to use the few UI elements I have in here.
