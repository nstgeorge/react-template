# React Template

This is the template I use for new React projects.

[Example deployment here.](https://nstgeorge.github.io/react-template/)

## How to Use

I recommend using degit to grab this repo, or you can click the "Use this template" button above.

```sh
degit nstgeorge/react-template my-project # grab the repo
cd my-project
npm install # install dependencies
npm run dev # start dev server
```

That should be it! Your page is at [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) by default. Feel free to use the few UI elements I have in here.

### Deployment

If you are deploying with GitHub Pages, there is some configuration you'll have to remove. In `package.json` replace the predeploy script with your own (or use this example):

```json
"predeploy": "npm run build",
```
